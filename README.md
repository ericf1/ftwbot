How To Set Up Your Own Bot From Your Personal Machine
---
>First, fetch our code base through git clone:
```
git clone https://github.com/ericf1/ftwbot.git
```
or through downloading the source code that is avaliable in the [versions](https://github.com/ericf1/ftwbot/releases)

>Install the necessary libraries by running:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

>Change directories to the python code files with:
```
cd src
```

>Create a .env file containing the following inside of the src folder with vim or your favorite text editor:
```
vim .env
```

>You will need a personal Discord Token, Twitter API Key, and Twitter Access Token. Your .env file should be formatted like this:
```
TWITTER_API_KEY=
TWITTER_API_SECRET_KEY=
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=
DISCORD_TOKEN=
```
You can find these keys from the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info) and [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)

>In vim, to save and exit, execute:
```
:wq
```

>Start the bot with:
```
python3 bot.py
```

Our Python code is currently set to check for new posts every ten minutes (this can be changed in under the parameter of the mainLoop).

In order to constantly maintain the bot, we recommend running the Python script through a Cloud Hosting Service such as [Amazon Web Service](https://aws.amazon.com/). We currently run an instance of ubuntu through AWS.
